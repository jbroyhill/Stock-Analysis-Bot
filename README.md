# Stock Analysis Bot

This is a Stock Analysis bot that takes a stock and analyzes its current statistics, assembling a volatility analysis for the user so they can consider whether or not to trade it.

Originally I was going to have the bot predict future stock prices, but I decided instead on current analysis instead with a focus on volatility.

The only thing needed for this bot to work is the "nasdaq3.csv" file to read from and the python libraries it seeks to import (pandas, TimeSeries, Time, and csv).

The application allows the user to query a spreadsheet of stocks to gain their symbol or vice versa before searching the stock's statistics for an analysis.

I hope you enjoy the bot!
